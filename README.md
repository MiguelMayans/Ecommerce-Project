## About the Project

The main objective of this project is to get used to working with React, creating a website with all its components, routes, context, custom hooks, etc. In order to do so, I created a fictional e-commerce (with no backend at all) simulating a futuristic travel agency where you can buy tickets to go to other planets beyond the Solar System. It has basic functionalities such as add-to-cart, login, and checkout.
Hope you like it.
